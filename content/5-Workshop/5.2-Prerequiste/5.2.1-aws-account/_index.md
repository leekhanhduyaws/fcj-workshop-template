2. Fill in the registration details:
   - **Email address**: Your email address
   - **AWS account name**: Account name (e.g., `flashlearn-workshop`)

## 2. Enable Security (MFA)

After registering, **enabling MFA** on the root account is mandatory to protect your account:

1. Log in to the **AWS Console**
2. Click on your account name (top right) → **Security credentials**
3. Under **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** → **Assign MFA device**
4. Select **Authenticator app** and follow the instructions

## 3. Create an IAM User for the Workshop

>  **Do not** use the root account for day-to-day tasks. Create an IAM User with appropriate permissions.

1. Search for **IAM** in the search bar → **Users** → **Create user**

2. Configure the user:
   - **User name**: `flashlearn-admin`
   - Check **Provide user access to the AWS Management Console**
   - Select **I want to create an IAM user**
   - **Console password**: Set a strong password

3. Attach permissions → **Attach policies directly** → search and select **AdministratorAccess**

## 4. Set Up AWS Budget Alert

To avoid unexpected charges, configure a budget alert:

1. Search for **Billing and Cost Management** → **Budgets** → **Create budget**

2. Select **Use a template** → **Zero spend budget**

3. Enter your alert email → **Create budget**

>  **Zero spend budget** sends an email as soon as any service incurs a charge (even $0.01), helping you detect issues promptly.
